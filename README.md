# Neural-Net

Over the coruse of my enrollment of CSC 499, I began to develop a Neural Network to develop my skills in the machine learning field.

Included in this repository are two files which are the results of my efforts.

Neural Network.py - This is my first success at developing a neural network. It is an expandable, and object oriented neural net that I initially tested by teaching basic logic gates. As shown in the program it is sucessful at learning logic gates.

sentiment_analysis.py - This was my first attempt at teaching my neural network how to handle information that would actually be of some use. As a first step I decided to go with sentiment analysis, and have my neural net analyze a sentence for being positive, or negative. In order to train the neural network I used a library which provided a multitude of tweets from an online database, each labeled as positive or negative. Once run through the neural net the user has the opportunity to enter their own sentence for analysis. Though it is not perfect, I gained a greater understanding of how to go about, and the intricacies of training a neural network.

To run these programs download and run in any python enviroment.
